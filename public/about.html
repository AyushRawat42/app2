                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2025, Parts Genie started as a small family-owned business with a passion for cars and a commitment to providing high-quality, affordable auto parts. 
                    Over the years, we have grown into a trusted name in the industry, serving thousands of customers across the country. Our journey began in a small garage, 
                    and today, we operate a state-of-the-art facility with a vast inventory of used engines, transmissions, and turbos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe in giving vehicles a second life by offering reliable used parts that meet the needs of car enthusiasts, mechanics, and everyday drivers alike. 
                    Our dedication to quality and customer satisfaction has been the driving force behind our success.
